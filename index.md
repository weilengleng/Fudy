<p> Fudy is a new application being developed by University of Melbourne students. We would like to thank you for allowing your curiosity to get the better of you and scanning the QR code!
  <br />
<p> Our vision for Fudy involves mapping out a selection of tables in the libraries and in the student lounges to help students like you find a place to study.
  <br />
<p> Each study spot will have a QR code in front of it, just like the table that you are sitting at. When a student sits down to study at a "Fudy" table, they will need to scan the QR code and input how long they will be in that study spot for. This will be updated on a real time map that application users will be able to view. When the student leaves, they will need to "scan out" and again this will be updated on the map.
  <br />
<p> To create more incentive for students to scan in and out, they will have the opporunity to gain points everytime they scan. These points can be redeemed for food vouchers. If there is anything that students enjoy, it's cheap food!
  <br />
  <p> Moreover, accroding to the scientific experiments, people could show excellent focus on doing one single thing in 40 minutes and after that the performance of focusing will keep going down and is hard for people to achieve efficient work. So, we share a counting down function for helping you study here. We advise you chould set 40 minutes working and 10 minutes gap for having a short rest!. Feel free to have a try! <a href="https://greyli.github.io/pomodoro/"> Pomodoro Clock</a>

<p> Our team would love to hear your feedback on the concept, if you have anything you would like to tell us, would like to have more information or would even like to work with us, please fill out this Google <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevrbuux86zDOM5tgVasoI7oqa2XSmrMYuPUnepvgnHAVvQuw/viewform?usp=sf_link "> form</a> and we will get back to you shortly.
  <br />
<p>Regards,
   <br />
