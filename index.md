<p> Fudy is a new application being developed by University of Melbourne students. We would like to thank you for allowing your curiosity to get the better of you and scanning the QR code!
  <br />
<p> Fudy, with the help of the university, will map out a selection of tables in the libraries, in the student lounges and help students like you find a place to study.
  <br />
<p> Each study spot will have a QR code in front of it, just like the table that you are sitting at. When a student sits down to study at a "Fudy" table, they will need to scan the QR code and input how long they will be in that study spot. This will be updated on a real time map that application users will be able to view. When the student leaves, they will need to "scan out" and again this will be updated on the map.
  <br />
<p> To create more incentive for students to scan in and out, they will have the opporunity to gain points everytime they scan. These points can be redeemed for food vouchers. If there is anything that students enjoy, it's cheap food!
  <br />
<p> Moreover, accroding to the scientific evidence, people could keep excellent focus on doing one thing in 40 minutes and after that the focusing will going down and hard for people to achieve efficient work. So, we share a counting down function for helping you study here. We advise you chould set 40 minutes working and 10 minutes gap for having a short rest!. Feel free to have a try! <ahref="https://greyli.github.io/pomodoro/">
  <br />
<p> Our team would love to hear your feedback on the concept, if you have anything you would like to tell us, would like to have more information or would even like to work with us, please fill out this Google <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSevrbuux86zDOM5tgVasoI7oqa2XSmrMYuPUnepvgnHAVvQuw/viewform?usp=sf_link "> form</a> and we will get back to you shortly.
  <br />
<p>Regards,
   <br />
